    "\n",
    "**Description:** Import the initial English AFT dataset (downloaded from https://old.datahub.io/dataset/wikipedia-article-feedback-corpus) and create features for exploratory analysis and classifier.  The processed dataset should include the following **feature fields**:\n",
    "* unique ID\n",
    "* original ID (these are non-unique but could be useful for debugging)\n",
    "* article and revision ID\n",
    "* comment (might have to remove stop tokens)\n",
    "* article topic from https://github.com/wikimedia/drafttopic\n",
    "* article features - TBD\n",
    "* vandalism score from https://github.com/wikimedia/draftquality\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset should also include the following **class fields**:\n",
    "* helpful/un-helpful\n",
    "* non-actionable"

      "135981c7-b984-dbe3-aef8-2d2e51f83e44 Ambassador Christopher Stevens was in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the day he died in a terrorist attack, because Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ordered him there.  Hillary Clinton had given Stevens direct instructions to prepare the CIA compound in Benghazi to be upgraded to the status of a U.S. diplomatic mission and Stevens, in complying with Clintonâs wishes, was in Benghazi the first time he had the opportunity to do so, cognizant of the need to visit the site before the end of the fiscal year, on Sept. 30, 2012.\n",
      " Barack Obama campaigned partly on his foreign policy successes and he did this by making the claim that al Qaeda was on the run and fractured. The Benghazi attack flew in the face of that claim so the Obama regime had to downplay the attack in order for Barack Obama to maintain his credibility, thus the cover-up in order to help the president win reelection.  And that is the best case scenario, the true reason could be much worse. \n",
      "The attacks happened September 11th.  The State Department was in communication with the consulate while it was under attack.   By September 25th, it would have been clear to any President who called upon the people within the State Department that the murder of the US Ambassador was not in response to a video, but a coordinated military operation by Al Qaeda in response to the recent death of their Libyan Al Qaeda leader.  Yet, this is what President Obama said to the UN on September 2th \n",
      " She also tried to gain sympathy by making the Benghazi attack a personal issue by invoking the spirit of Barack Obama from the third debate with Mitt Romney when he mentioned greeting the flag draped coffins after the attack. Here is what she had to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "spoke tearfully of having âstood next to President Obama as the Marines [who] carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews.â \n",
      "\n",
      "âI put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters,â she said. âAnd the wives left alone to raise their children\n",
      "\n",
      "  Is there any doubt what the motive here was? It was the same motive Barack Obama had. Hillary Clinton is not a victim\n",
      "The differential treatment partly reflects the traditional deference shown by the legislature to presidential appointees, but also reflects a phenomenon referred to by the witnesses on Wednesday, who noted that the key decisions had been made by \"presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed\" officials, yet those disciplined thus far had been career civil servants. The message, they said, was that \"if you're above a certain level\" you will not be held accountable.\n",
      "Secretary of State Clinton made at least three statements that have been contradicted by subsequent testimony. First, she told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that \"we didn't have a clear picture\" of what had happened in Benghazi. Yet Greg Hicks, who had been second in command at the U.S. mission in Libya, testified Wednesday that he spoke to Clinton on the night of Sep. 11-12 and told her exactly what had happened.\n",
      "Second, Clinton told the Senate: \"So I saw firsthand what Ambassador Pickering and former Chairman Mullen called timely and exceptional coordination: no delays in decision-making, no denials of support from Washington or from our military.\" Yet testimony on Wednesday revealed that help was denied twice--once when support from the State Department's Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST) was denied, and once when Lt. Col. Gibson was told to stand down.\n",
      "Third, Clinton told the Senate that she had not seen diplomatic cables from Libya requesting more security: \"I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them.\" Yet Gen. Dempsey appeared to cast some doubt on Clinton's testimony when he told the Senate in February that it seemed unlikely she had not seen the cables: âI would call myself surprised that she didnât.â\n",
      "Given these contradictions, it appears that Clinton misled Congress. But she did not do so under oath, and it would be difficult to prove her guilty of \"knowingly and willfully\" concealing material facts when she was reporting her memories and impressions of a volatile situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "But \"What difference at this point does it make???\"\n",
